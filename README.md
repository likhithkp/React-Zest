# Zest Recipe App

## Description

  Zest Recipe App is a web application developed from scratch using ReactJS, SASS for styling, and the Edamam API for fetching recipe data. This project demonstrates building a dynamic and interactive recipe platform. The app allows users to browse, search, and view recipes, leveraging the power of React hooks and the transmission of data through props.
